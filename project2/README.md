# Mini Project 2: Classification of Textual Data

## Packages

- Install `nltk`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` in your virtual environment.

## Datasets

- Download the movie reviews dataset and put the `aclImdb_v1.tar.gz` file in the `datasets` subfolder.
- The 20 newsgroups dataset is automatically downloaded by `scikit-learn`.

## Experiments

- (Optional) Edit `classifier_params.py` to select the features, classifiers, and hyperparameters on which to perform grid search.
- Run `experiments.py`. If there are many combinations in the grid search, the script may take a while to complete.
